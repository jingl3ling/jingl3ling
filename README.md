### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jing
#### I am a Software Engineer / Full-stack Developer
I study Computer Engineering (class of 2022) at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I have a strong background in Python and Java programming languages. In January 2021, I began to serve as an IT specialist at Spurlock Museum, responsible for website development and maintenance through using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I have helped numerous organizations and individuals build their webpages. Passionate for art and design, I love to draw in acrylic, create graphics using Figma, design cosplay costumes, and make my own clothes. In my spare time, I play a variety of sports, including boxing and swimming. An animal lover, I volunteer at an animal shelter where I routinely walk and take care of dogs.

Skills: PYTHON/ JAVA / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
